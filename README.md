## Question 1 model answer

Handling missing data is a crucial aspect of data preprocessing in data science. There are several techniques to address missing values:

1. Deletion:
   1. Pros: Simple and quick.
   2. Cons: Can lead to loss of valuable information, especially if missing data is not completely random.
2. Imputation:
   1. Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:
      1. Pros: Preserves the overall distribution; easy to implement.
      2. Cons: May distort relationships between variables.
   2. Regression Imputation:
      1. Pros: Preserves relationships between variables.
      2. Cons: Assumes a linear relationship; sensitive to outliers.
   3. Advanced Imputation Methods (e.g., K-nearest neighbors, predictive modeling):
      1. Pros: Can capture complex relationships; more accurate.
      2. Cons: Computationally expensive; may not perform well with high-dimensional data.
   4. Interpolation/Extrapolation:
      1. Pros: Preserves trends in time-series data.
      2. Cons: Assumes a linear relationship; may not be suitable for non-linear trends.
3. Machine Learning-Based Methods:
   1. Pros: Utilizes the power of predictive models.
   2. Cons: Requires a significant amount of data; may introduce bias.

The choice of method depends on the nature of the data, the extent of ***missingness***, and the specific requirements of the analysis. It's essential to carefully evaluate and justify the chosen approach in each case.â€ƒ

## Question 2 answer

Developing a predictive model for a binary classification problem involves several key steps. Here's a structured approach:

1. Data Exploration and Understanding:
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features, identify outliers, and assess the balance of classes in the target variable.
   - Examine summary statistics, visualize distributions, and detect any patterns or correlations in the data.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies using appropriate techniques discussed in the previous question.
   - Encode categorical variables using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Scale numerical features if necessary to bring them to a comparable scale.
3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns.
   - Consider techniques such as polynomial features, interaction terms, or domain-specific feature engineering.

4. Model Selection:
   - Choose an appropriate classification algorithm based on the nature of the problem, the size of the dataset, and computational resources.
   - Popular algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

5. Model Training:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on one subset and evaluate its performance on another.
   - Train the chosen model using the training data, tuning hyperparameters as needed.

6. Model Evaluation:
   - Assess the model's performance on the testing set using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Utilize cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.

7. Model Interpretability:
   - If applicable, interpret the model's predictions to gain insights into the factors contributing to the classification.
   - Utilize tools like feature importance plots or [SHAP values for interpretability]( https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-shap-values-machine-learning-interpretability).

8. Model Deployment and Monitoring:
   - Deploy the model in a production environment if satisfactory performance is achieved.
   - Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect and address any drift in data distribution over time.

The success of a predictive model depends not only on its accuracy but also on its interpretability, generalization to new data, and suitability for deployment in real-world scenarios.

## Question 3 answer

Open `ds.ipynb` as a Jupyter notebook or simply create a `.py` python script file with the below code

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Step 1: Import the data
df = pd.read_csv('retail_sales_data.csv')

# Step 2: Explore the dataset
print(df.info())
print(df.head())

# Step 3: Clean the data
# Handling missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Handling outliers (assuming Revenue cannot be negative)
df = df[df['Revenue'] >= 0]

# Step 4: Calculate total revenue per month
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.to_period('M')
monthly_revenue = df.groupby('Month')['Revenue'].sum()

# Step 5: Create visualizations
monthly_revenue_df = pd.DataFrame({'Month': monthly_revenue.index.astype(str), 'Revenue': monthly_revenue.values})

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=monthly_revenue_df, x='Month', y='Revenue', marker='o')
plt.title('Monthly Revenue Trends')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue ($)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Run the script file with `python <scriptname>.py` and after a couple of seconds, you should get a screen showing something similar to the below
